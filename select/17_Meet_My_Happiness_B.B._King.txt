Oh, come on, come over here and meet my happiness
Oh, out she is, meet my happiness
Yeah, she's gonna take care of me an' make me happy
Yeah, from now 'til the lonely years
Yeah, she loves me with her heart and steel of a mind
Yeah, she loves me with her heart, people
With her heart and steel of a mind
I know my love is gonna last, it's just gotta last
Oh no, until the end of time, alright

Oh, there I was just a standin' there
Oh, I say, there I was, people, I was just standin' there
I had no one to love me, I had no one to care

Oh, but she offered, she offered her love to me
Somethin' no one has ever done
Oh, my baby offered her love to me
Somethin' no one has ever done
Yet, I have no regrets now, this is one thing I know
