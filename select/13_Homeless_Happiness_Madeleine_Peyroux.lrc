[00:07.98] I sit here content my thoughts and my feelings
[00:14.83] Remembering who I used to be
[00:21.86] The life I have now is much more appealing
[00:29.15] No hurries no worries for me
[00:43.15] 
[00:42.59] A bench by the shore a coat for my pillow
[00:49.62] A future with no guarantee
[00:57.76] The world was a rat race and I had my fill oh
[01:05.57] No hurries no worries for me
[01:19.57] 
[01:12.96] Homeless Happiness
[01:19.86] My castle
